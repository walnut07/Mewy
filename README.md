# Tech Stack
- TypeScript
- React
- React Bootstrap
- Go
- Gin
- go-pg
- Firebase

# The purposes of the project
I did this project to expand my tech stack. In a more specified way, I wanted...

- To know what the web development in Go looks like
- To get a better understanding of React especially some concepts such as
  - Hooks (useState, useEffect)
  - Routes
  - Navigate
- To get familiar with Authentication with Firebase

I learned Go for the first time and build this app within only four days. I didn't fully finish all the features but the goal was learning!

# Reflection

- I found it fun to work with Go the language itself. However, I didn't quite understand go-pg which an ORM that I chose for this project.
- I felt like Go is suitable for a large-scale application. 
  - The beaty of Go is its readability. Hence it may accelarate Team Development to some context.
  - Compared to other frameworks like Flask, Django, or Ruby on Rails, I felt like Go is still not easy to built products with.
- Atomic Design difficult. 
  - In my previous project [Globally](https://github.com/walnut07/Globally), I organized React components based on Atomic Design. But this time I couldn't make the app as organized since its structure is more complicated; it has multiple routes!
  - I've got a good lesson that it really counts to design components first when it comes to frontend development.
